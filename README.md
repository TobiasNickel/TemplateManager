# ejsTemplateManager

This tool small framework help you to work with ejs templates. It let you easily structure your templete in a hierarchy. In near future I want to add a server side compilation process to let all templates compile and make them Available in a single file.

Now it can load templates from <template>-tags or via name throu ajax. I want to make shure, to let this templateManager also work on NodeJS and as an template-Engine in Express.
